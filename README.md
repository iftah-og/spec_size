# Speculative Size: Exploring Perception Through Sound Scaling 

This repository explores the relationship between the size of an object and its sound, focusing on how slowing down or speeding up recordings can simulate changes in the perceived size of the object.  

## Features  
- Analysis of fundamental frequency and timbre changes.  
- Comparison of recordings of proportionally scaled wood cylinder.
